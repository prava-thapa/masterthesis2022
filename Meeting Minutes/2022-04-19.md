**Agenda**

The agenda is to be created before the meeting. It should start with action items from the last meeting, prefixed with a status flag: [done] / [in progress] / [not started].

**Action items from the previous meeting**

1. *[done] Create Noise Augmented Dataset, the total samples now are 46800 (23400 up and 23400 down)*
1. *[done] training the model with test 2 as test set for 1560 samples (780 up and 780 down)*
1. *[done] training the model with test 8 as test set for 46800 noise augmented samples (23400 up and 23400 down)*
1. *[done] training the model with test 8 as test set for 46800 noise augmented samples (23400 up and 23400 down)*

**Discussion notes**

*Things that were discussed during the meeting.*

1. *Model training with test 8 as test set for 1560 samples (780 up and 780 down)*

|*Model Evaluation On*|*Precision*|
| :-: | :-: |
|*Training Set (Test 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)*|*1*|
|*Validation Set (Test 6)*|*0.96*|
|*Test Set (Test 8)*|*0.7*|

2. *Model training with test 2 as test set for 1560 samples (780 up and 780 down)*

|*Model Evaluation On*|*Precision*|
| :-: | :-: |
|*Training Set (Test 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8)*|*1*|
|*Validation Set (Test 8)*|*0.99*|
|*Test Set (Test 2)*|*1*|

3. *Model training with automatic split for 46800 samples (23400 up and 23400 down). The split is done as:*

import splitfolders as sp

sp.ratio('data/img\_data', output="data/model\_data", seed=1337, ratio=(.8, .1, .1))

`	`*The data is splitted into 80% training data, 10% validation data and 10% test data.* 

*Model Evaluation with this splitting can be seen in the table below:*

|*Model Evaluation On*|*Precision*|
| :-: | :-: |
|*Training Set (80%)*|*0.99*|
|*Validation Set (10%)*|*0.99*|
|*Test Set (10%)*|*0.99*|

==> *There are 1169 HighNoiseBackground, 1193 HighNoise and 1037 LowNoise. 10 each from these noise samples are selected in random and augmented with 1560 (780 up and 780 down) audio samples. Each click (up clicks and down clicks) sample is augmented with 30 noise samples generating total of 46800 (23400 up and 23400 down) samples.*

==> *We can use a new approach in splitting the normal dataset and augmented dataset where the training set will have samples from 3 phones (60%), validation set will have samples from 1 phone (20%) and test set will have samples from 1 phone (20%) => (3:1:1).* 

*This could be achieved manually or by writing an automatic script.*

**Action items**

*To-dos until the next meeting. The list should include the supervisor's to-dos, prefixed with [VS].*

1. *Split both normal dataset (1560 samples: 780 up and 780 down) and noise augmented dataset (46800 samples: 23400 up and 23400 down) in a way where training set will have samples from 3 phones, validation set will have samples from 1 phone and test set will have samples from 1 phone.*
1. *Once the splitting is done, train the model with both normal and augmented data and see if the evaluation improves and note down the changes.*

**Next meeting**
