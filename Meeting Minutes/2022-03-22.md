**Minutes 2022-03-22**

**Agenda**

The agenda is to be created before the meeting. It should start with action items from the last meeting, prefixed with a status flag: [done] / [in progress] / [not started].

**Action items from the previous meeting**

1. *[in progress] training the model*

**Discussion notes**

*Things that were discussed during the meeting.*

*A CNN model is used. This Sequential model consists of three convolution blocks (tf.keras.layers.Conv2D) with a max pooling layer (tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D) in each of them. There's a fully-connected layer (tf.keras.layers.Dense) with 128 units on top of it that is activated by a ReLU activation function ('relu').* 

*The model is not learning as we are getting a constant val\_accuracy of 0.5 and loss of 0.69.*

**Action items**

*To-dos until the next meeting. The list should include the supervisor's to-dos, prefixed with [VS].*

1. *Fix the model, figure out why it is not learning*
1. *[VS] Todo3*

**Next meeting**
