**Minutes 2022-01-12**

**Agenda**

The agenda is to be created before the meeting. It should start with action items from the last meeting, prefixed with a status flag: [done] / [in progress] / [not started].

**Action items from the previous meeting**

1. *[done] loading the raw samples and visualizing them, listening to them*
1. *[in progress] creating a model that isolates up and down click*
1. *[not started] creating subsamples*

...

**Discussion notes**

*More efficient ways for isolating clicks: detecting both up and down clicks and split on the middle to get the required parts. In doing so, it is necessary to look at the signal to see how far apart the up and down clicks are. Once this is done, we need to plot the sample to visualize the respective clicks. Once we get the subsamples, we can then start feeding them to more real time machine learning approaches.*

**Action items**

*To-dos until the next meeting. The list should include the supervisor's to-dos, prefixed with [VS].*

1. *Creating an efficient script that would isolate the clicks: up and down.*
1. *Creating subsamples, once the clicks have been isolated.*
1. *[VS] Todo3*

**Next meeting**
