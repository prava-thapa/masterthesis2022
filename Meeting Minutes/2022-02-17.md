**Minutes 2022-02-17**

The meeting was rescheduled from 2022-02-15 to 2022-02-17. 

**Agenda**

The agenda is to be created before the meeting. It should start with action items from the last meeting, prefixed with a status flag: [done] / [in progress] / [not started].

**Action items from the previous meeting**

1. *[done] found out the location of the up clicks and down clicks and stored them separately on different variables.*
1. *[in progress] using these locations of up and down clicks, we need to create small audio samples of up clicks and down clicks.*
1. *[not started] creating subsamples*

**Discussion notes**

*Things that were discussed during the meeting.*

*I was confused over how to isolate the clicks. I was thinking about the positions of the clicks and the sound itself. The meeting with the professor made is clear that the positions of the clicks can be a valuable information while isolating clicks but cannot be a subsample.*

**Action items**

*To-dos until the next meeting. The list should include the supervisor's to-dos, prefixed with [VS].*

1. *Create the subsamples,*
1. *investigate ML models.*
1. *[VS] Todo3*

**Next meeting**
