**Minutes 2022-03-08**

The meeting was rescheduled from 2022-02-22 to 2022-03-08 as I was sick from corona.

**Agenda**

The agenda is to be created before the meeting. It should start with action items from the last meeting, prefixed with a status flag: [done] / [in progress] / [not started].

**Action items from the previous meeting**

1. *[done] isolated the up and down clicks. These isolated clicks are the subsamples.*
1. *[in progress] preparing subsamples to train the model. Investigating ML models* 
1. *[not started] Training the model.*

**Discussion notes**

*Things that were discussed during the meeting.*

*The subsamples that were created had different audio lengths. The input to the model should be fixed length input. One way to solve this problem would be to store wav file with max length. The other way would be to look into all the test folder to find an example where up and down click is really close and find a small window that covers the clicks and use that as a length for all the clicks. Need to figure out how many samples the window size is*

**Action items**

*To-dos until the next meeting. The list should include the supervisor's to-dos, prefixed with [VS].*

1. *Fix the sample length.* 
1. *investigate ML models.*
1. *[VS] Todo3*

**Next meeting**
