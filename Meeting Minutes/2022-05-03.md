**Agenda**

The agenda is to be created before the meeting. It should start with action items from the last meeting, prefixed with a status flag: [done] / [in progress] / [not started].

**Action items from the previous meeting**

1. *[done] Split both normal dataset (1560 samples: 780 up and 780 down) and noise augmented dataset (46800 samples: 23400 up and 23400 down) in a way where training set will have samples from 3 phones, validation set will have samples from 1 phone and test set will have samples from 1 phone.*
1. *[done] setting up tensorflow 2.0 in Linux server*
1. *[in progress] creating input pipeline to train the model*
1. *[in progress] train the model with both normal and augmented data and see if the evaluation improves and note down the changes.*

**Discussion notes**

*Things that were discussed during the meeting.*

1. *We use a new approach in splitting the normal dataset and augmented dataset.*

*For example: A test folder that has dataset from all 5 phones will be distributed in a way where the training set will have samples from 3 phones (60%), validation set will have samples from 1 phone (20%) and test set will have samples from 1 phone (20%) => (3:1:1).* 

*For the test folders where data is not available from all 5 phones, we distribute them with respect to the overall dataset maintaining our training set has overall 60% of the dataset, 20% test set and 20% validation set.*

*We are opting for 60:20:20 because of the nature of our dataset. The data is limited, and they are only slightly different to each other.*

*This is achieved manually.*

*Out of 46,800 (23,400 up and 23,400 down), the dataset is splitted in 60:20:20, where:*

- *Train: 28,800 (14.400 up and 14,400 down)*
- *Test: 9,000 (4,500 up and 4,500 down)*
- *Val: 9,000 (4,500 up and 4,500 down*

*The distribution of the dataset with respect to phones in train, test, val is:*

||***train***|***test***|***val***|
| - | - | - | - |
|*Test1*|<p>*Apple*</p><p>*Huawei*</p><p>*Motorola*</p>|*SM-20F*|*SM-30F*|
|*Test2*|<p>*Motorola*</p><p>*SM-20F*</p><p>*SM-30F*</p>|*Huawei*|*Apple*|
|*Test3*|<p>*Apple*</p><p>*SM-20F*</p><p>*SM-30F*</p>|*Motorola*|*Huawei*|
|*Test4*|*Motorola*|*Apple*||
|*Test5*|*SM-30F*||*Motorola*|
|*Test6*|<p>*Apple*</p><p>*Huawei*</p><p>*Motorola*</p>|*SM-30F*||
|*Test8*|<p>*Huawei*</p><p>*Motorola*</p>||*SM-20F*|

1. *While using ‘tf.keras.utils.image\_dataset\_from\_directory’ in order to create input pipeline to train image classification models with tf.keras in the server I am unable to use “image\_dataset\_from\_directory” attribute because it is deprecated for tensorflow 2.0 (that is compatible with the installed CUDA in the server).*

*Using other methods to create input pipelines can work, but using this attribute is more optimal, faster and less complicated.*

*Another thing to focus this week is to talk to necessary people to fix the version problems in the server meanwhile running the model in local machine.*
