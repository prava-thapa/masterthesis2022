**Minutes 2022-01-21**

The meeting on 2022-01-19 was re-scheduled today. 

**Agenda**

The agenda is to be created before the meeting. It should start with action items from the last meeting, prefixed with a status flag: [done] / [in progress] / [not started].

**Action items from the previous meeting**

1. *[done] explored librosa library for audio manipulation in Python, explored feature extraction from audio signal, explored bandpass filter and FFT*
1. *[in progress] implementation of bandpass filter and FFT for our dataset in python*
1. *[not started] creation of subsamples to feed into models

**Discussion notes**

*The signals in the dataset from 'first session - one manikin' are clear enough to extract 'up' and 'down' clicks. So these samples of raw signals can be used without any application of bandpass filter and FFT. The main focus for now should be in seperating up and down clicks and creating the subsamples so that we can have a dataset of subsamples to start testing the models. When doing so, it is preferable to use a piece of signal by defining a sliding window rather than experimenting on the entire signal.*

**Action items**

*To-dos until the next meeting. The list should include the supervisor's to-dos, prefixed with [VS].*

1. *Look into the raw signals, plot the raw signals and define a method to find out the clicks*
1. *Make subsamples and look into the models that we can use to train with our subsamples in order to detect clicks.*
1. *[VS] Todo3*

**Next meeting**
