**Minutes 2022-03-08**

**Agenda**

The agenda is to be created before the meeting. It should start with action items from the last meeting, prefixed with a status flag: [done] / [in progress] / [not started].

**Action items from the previous meeting**

1. *[done] Making the dataset cleaner. Extracted up clicks and down clicks to use them as subsample.*
1. *[not started] Training the model.*

**Discussion notes**

*Things that were discussed during the meeting.*

*The variable length of audio will generate ambiguity while training the model. Therefore, a fixed length is required. There should be an equality check for all the subsamples.*

*The audio data for test 7 has no clicks in them so we will be disregarding data from that folder*

**Action items**

*To-dos until the next meeting. The list should include the supervisor's to-dos, prefixed with [VS].*

1. *Fix the sample length.* 
1. *investigate ML models.*
1. *[VS] Todo3*

**Next meeting**
