**Minutes 2022-03-29**

**Agenda**

The agenda is to be created before the meeting. It should start with action items from the last meeting, prefixed with a status flag: [done] / [in progress] / [not started].

**Action items from the previous meeting**

1. *[in progress] training the model*

**Discussion notes**

*Things that were discussed during the meeting.*

*The model is overfitted. While evaluating the model with training set the score is 1, with validation set, it is 0.96 and with a test set it is 0.7. The test set has samples from Test 8. The experiments on Test 8 are different from the other test cases as it was carried out in a hard floor. The model hasn’t seen data like this. As a result, we have a very low score when evaluating with test 8.* 

*We should include all the variations in the training set. For now, we will use test 2 for test set.*

*The other task is to augment the subsamples with noise and make a larger dataset. Then use test 8 as test set for bigger dataset and see if there is any improvement on the evaluation result, otherwise use test 2 as test set.*

**Action items**

*To-dos until the next meeting. The list should include the supervisor's to-dos, prefixed with [VS].*

1. *Use test 2 as test set*
1. *Augment subsamples with noise to make a larger dataset*
1. *Use test 8 as test set for augmented data and see if evaluation increases otherwise use test 2 as test set*
