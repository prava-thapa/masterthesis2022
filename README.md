**Master thesis 2022**

The codes used in master thesis “Real time click detection for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) Training with Mini-Anne” are mentioned here. The codes for performing different tasks and their respective names are as follows:

**Click Detection and Isolation**

clicks\_dec\_iso.ipynb has codes for clicks detection and isolation. This is under the folder code/

**Create polyphonic audio mix**

audio\_mix.ipynb has codes for creating audio subsamples that has background noise overlaid on them. This is under the folder code/

**Create a third class**

make\_third\_class.ipynb has codes for creating a third class, i.e., background noise. This is under the folder code/

**Generate Feature**

gen\_mfcc\_img.ipynb generates spectrograms with MFFCs. gen\_mfcc.ipynb generates an array of MFCCs. gen\_log\_mel\_img.ipynb generates spectrogram with log-scaled mel spectrograms. These are under the folder code/
